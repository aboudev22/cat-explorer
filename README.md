Cat Explorer is a small web application built with React, using TanStack Query to manage API requests to [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/) and Zustand for global state management.

Users can:

    - Browse random cat images

    - Filter cats by breed

    - Add cats to their favorites

    - Enjoy a clean and responsive UI

This project is focused on learning how to consume REST APIs with TanStack Query and manage global state using Zustand.
